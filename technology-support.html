    <h1>GalaxyBrite 360 Setup Guide</h1>
    
    <p>This guide provides instructions for using the GalaxyBrite 360 app to configure your pool lights. The app supports both RGBW lights and white lights, allowing you to switch between control platforms and adjust color temperature and brightness settings.</p>

    <h2>RGBW Light Configuration</h2>
    <p>In the RGBW Light section, users can select from three popular brands to adapt the RGBW light fixtures to the corresponding control system. After selecting the desired brand, simply press the “Program” button to apply the configuration. The NFC function will initiate, and the app will send the necessary setup information to the pool light product.</p>

    <h2>White Light Configuration</h2>
    <p>In the White Light section, you can adjust the color temperature and brightness of the white light fixtures:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The top bar and buttons allow you to set the color temperature, with options ranging from 2700K to 6500K.</li>
        <li>The bottom bar and buttons control brightness levels, offering preset values from 0% to 100%.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Once your desired settings are selected, press the “Program” button to write the configuration to the pool light. The “Read” button allows you to view the current settings in the pool light product, which will be displayed within the app.</p>

    <h2>Current Setting Display</h2>
    <p>The Current Setting section shows the active color temperature and brightness (for white lights) or the brand control system (for RGBW lights) currently configured on the pool light.</p>
